# Project Summary: Last Mile Delivery Cost and Warehouse Optimization

In the Last Mile Delivery Cost and Warehouse Optimization project, I utilized advanced machine learning techniques to predict delivery costs and optimize warehouse operations. This project involved the following key steps:

	1.	Data Collection and Cleaning: Data from multiple sources, including customer orders, warehouse locations, and delivery distances, was collected. Extensive data cleaning was performed to address inconsistencies and missing values.
	2.	Distance Calculation: I developed a function to calculate the distance between customer locations and various warehouses using geodesic distance calculations. This helped in determining the nearest warehouse for each customer.
	3.	Feature Engineering: Important features such as order price, delivery charges, and distances to warehouses were engineered to improve the prediction models.
	4.	Model Development: Multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso, were developed and fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to predict delivery costs. Cross-validation techniques were employed to ensure model robustness.
	5.	Warehouse Optimization: Anomalies in warehouse assignments were identified and corrected. Customers were reassigned to the nearest warehouses to minimize delivery costs and enhance efficiency.
	6.	Visualization and Reporting: Data visualizations were created to illustrate the findings and improvements. The results showed significant potential for cost savings and operational efficiency improvements.

This project demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning and data analysis techniques to real-world logistics and supply chain problems, providing actionable insights to optimize operations and reduce costs.
